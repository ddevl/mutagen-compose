If you have a question about Mutagen Compose or a feature request, please use
the Mutagen Community Slack Workspace to discuss:

For security issues, or even those that you merely suspect might be
security-related, please see the documentation for reporting security issues:

https://github.com/mutagen-io/mutagen-compose/blob/main/SECURITY.md


Issue templates aren't one-size-fits-all, so please feel free to summarize your
issue in whatever format you feel is most appropriate, but please include
relevant information such as:

- The version of Mutagen Compose that you're using (available via `mutagen-compose version`)
- The platform(s) that you're using (e.g. operating system/version/architecture)
- Reproduction steps (and ideally a test case to reproduce the issue)

The more information you provide, the easier it will be to diagnose the problem.

Thanks for taking the time to submit a report!
